settings_messagebox_what_is_cluster_enabled_header=What is enable multi-node cluster?
settings_messagebox_what_is_cluster_enabled_details=A VarAC Cluster is an advanced setup that enables you to run multiple VarAC instances simultaneously, all connected to a shared database. Each instance operates with its own RIG and VARA modem, yet they work in sync to support powerful cross-band capabilities such as VMail forwarding and the Email gateway.[NL][NL]Because all instances use the same shared database, any incoming VMail becomes instantly accessible across all bands. This effectively turns VarAC into a cross-band repeater for both VMails and Email settings_messages.[NL][NL]Additionally, the cluster allows others to perform tasks like 'last heard peaking'—helping them identify which band a specific callsign was recently heard on, whether through a beacon or CQ.[NL][NL]Setting up a VarAC Cluster is straightforward:[NL][NL]1. Create multiple VarAC profiles – Each should have its own VarAC_X.ini file, configured to work with a dedicated VARA modem and rig.[NL][NL]2. Launch all profiles simultaneously – By default, they will all connect to the same shared VarAC database (VarAC.db).[NL][NL]3. Enable Cluster Mode – In the settings of each instance, activate Cluster Mode and assign a shared Cluster ID to all.[NL][NL]4. Adjust additional parameters – Explore and configure other available cluster settings as needed (see below).[NL][NL]5. Email Gateway note – If you're running a VarAC Email Gateway, only one instance should be designated as the gateway handler. Refer to the Gateway Handler settings help for more details.
settings_messagebox_what_is_cluster_instance_number_header=What is an instance number?
settings_messagebox_what_is_cluster_instance_number_details=Each VarAC instance must have a unique instance number. This number is essential for various cluster operations, such as node-level logging, PTT lock synchronization, and identifying which instance is managing the Email Gateway.[NL][NL]When a cluster node is actively engaged in a QSO or link, its instance number will be displayed on the consoles of all other cluster nodes.
settings_messagebox_what_is_cluster_counters_refresh_rate_sec_header=What is counters refresh rate?
settings_messagebox_what_is_cluster_counters_refresh_rate_sec_details=VarAC displays various counters, such as incoming VMail, relay notifications, alerts, and more. While each VarAC cluster node maintains its own counters, it's crucial that all nodes reflect the most up-to-date values.[NL][NL]This parameter defines the interval (in seconds) at which a VarAC instance fetches updated counters from the shared database and updates the UI accordingly.[NL][NL]There is no need to modify this setting during standard operation.
settings_messagebox_what_is_cluster_ptt_lock_header=What is ptt lock?
settings_messagebox_what_is_cluster_ptt_lock_details=If you're running VarAC on a shared rig that supports multi-band operation—such as a modern SDR—but only allows transmission on one band at a time, enable the PTT lock.[NL][NL]When one VarAC cluster node is engaged in transmission, it will signal all other nodes to disable their PTT and refrain from transmitting until the active transmission is complete.[NL][NL]When a PTT lock is in effect, the non-transmitting nodes will display a visual indication on their consoles
settings_messagebox_what_is_cluster_email_gateway_handler_header=What is email gateway handler?
settings_messagebox_what_is_cluster_email_gateway_handler_details=In a VarAC cluster that also functions as an email gateway, only one node should be designated as the gateway handler. This prevents multiple nodes from simultaneously sending or receiving the same emails, which could lead to duplicate incoming and outgoing messages.[NL][NL]Ensure that only one node in your VarAC cluster is configured as the email gateway handler.
settings_groupbox_qsy=QSY
settings_checkbox_send_qsy_freq_offset=Send QSY Freq Offset
settings_messagebox_what_is_send_qsy_freq_offset_header=What is send QSY frequency offset?
settings_messagebox_what_is_send_qsy_freq_offset_details=There are two ways to send a QSY invitation:[NL][NL]Full Frequency – Sends the complete QSY frequency. This results in a longer transmission due to the number of characters.[NL][NL]Frequency Offset – Sends only the offset from the current frequency, making the message shorter and more emission-efficient.[NL][NL]Use the offset method only if both stations are running recent versions and have CAT control enabled, ensuring both sides know the current frequency and can accurately calculate the target frequency.
settings_checkbox_exchange_callid_snr_after_qsy_from_cf=Exchange Call ID and SNR after QSY from CF
settings_messagebox_what_is_checkbox_exchange_callid_snr_after_qsy_from_cf_header=What is exchange call ID and SNR after QSY?
settings_messagebox_what_is_checkbox_exchange_callid_snr_after_qsy_from_cf_details=Calling frequencies are designated for beaconing, CQ calls and initiating connections. Once a connection is established, it is crucial to send a QSY invitation and vacate the calling frequency to allow others to connect.[NL][NL]To streamline this process and minimize congestion on calling frequencies, VarAC by default will not exchange any QSO details such as CALL ID or SNR reports until a QSY has been completed.[NL][NL]It is strongly recommended not to disable this feature unless you are operating on a private calling frequency with your own team, outside of the official VarAC frequencies.

settings_checkbox_email_gateway_enable_incoming_emails=Enable incoming Emails
settings_messagebox_what_is_enable_incoming_emails_header=What is enable incoming emails?
settings_messagebox_what_is_enable_incoming_emails_details=The Email Gateway can send VMails to email addresses via SMTP, but it can also transfer emails—and their replies—back to VMail recipients over the air using IMAP.[NL][NL]Enable this option if you want the gateway to monitor its email account for new incoming messages and forward them as parking emails to your VMail inbox.[NL][NL]Recipients can then collect these messages using the standard relay notification method.

settings_messagebox_label_what_is_multi_band_last_heard_peeking_header=What is multi band last heard peeking?
settings_messagebox_label_what_is_multi_band_last_heard_peeking_details=By default, when a 'Last Heard' request is received, your station will report only the stations heard on the band you are currently tuned to.[NL][NL]To include callsigns from all bands, enable this feature.[NL][NL]In cluster mode, it allows reporting of stations heard across all active bands in your cluster.
