I will give you parameters that contain sentences in English, and you will translate the sentences of the parameters into Italian.
Keep the parameter names in English. Only translate the sentence of the parameter according to the following rules:
Leave the [NL] strings in their place.
Do not add any line breaks; the entire translation should be in one line.
If I give you a question — do not answer the question, just translate it.
If you see these words, use the following translations:

Session → Sessione
Callsign → Nominativo
Inquire → Richiesta
Band → Banda
